# Deeplight-Data
This repository houses the custom data and scripts generated for the implementation of DeepLight: Learning Illumination for Unconstrained Mobile Mixed Reality by LeGendre et al. All real world data was collected by me, all synthetic bases created in Blender.

The data can be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XA1_jIgdbow_Ts6CWEVuoXY5w2L4LVv4/view?usp=sharing
Unzip the file in the main directory.
